gredzikk: @workspace are all singletons build like static global objects following this descriptions
Printer & thePrinter() {
    static Printer printer;
    return printer;
}
This is technically a singleton though, this function can even be a static method of a class. So it guaranties to be constructed before used unlike with global static objects, that can be created in any order, making it possible to fail unconsistently when one global object uses another, quite a common scenario.

What makes it better than common way of doing singletons with creating new instance by calling new is that object destructor will be called at the end of a program. It won't happen with dynamically allocated singleton.

Another positive side is there's no way to access singleton before it gets created, even from other static methods or from subclasses. Saves you some debugging time.
iny my code? are there any other things you would improve or that need addressing or fixing redundancy, inconsistency etc. 
recommend me a static analysis tool and other tools which can tell me whats yet to improve

Workspace: Collecting workspace informationBased on your codebase, I can see several patterns and issues related to the singleton implementation and other architectural concerns. Let me analyze the code and provide recommendations.

## Singleton Implementation Analysis

Your codebase contains several singleton implementations with some inconsistencies:

1. **Good implementations**:
   - `SystemStateManager` uses the recommended static local object approach:
     ```cpp
     static SystemStateManager& get_instance() {
         static SystemStateManager instance;
         return instance;
     }
     ```
   - This implementation has proper mutex protection and deleted copy constructors/operators

2. **Inconsistent implementations**:
   - `SensorWrapper` uses the same pattern but has different implementations in test mocks

3. **Work in progress**:
   - The `NMEAData` class is being converted to a singleton but currently uses a pointer-based implementation rather than the safer static local object approach.

## Recommended Improvements

1. **Standardize singleton pattern**:
   Use the static local variable approach consistently:
   ```cpp
   static ClassName& get_instance() {
       static ClassName instance;
       return instance;
   }
   ```
   This is better than pointer-based implementations because:
   - It's thread-safe in C++11 and later
   - Handles automatic destruction
   - Avoids memory leaks
   - Ensures initialization before use

2. **Convert global instances to singletons**:
   - `PowerManager` in main.cpp should follow the singleton pattern
   - `DS3231` should be converted to follow the same pattern

3. **Improve mutex usage**:
   - Use RAII for mutex locking/unlocking to prevent missed unlocks in error paths
   - Standardize between regular and recursive mutexes based on need

4. **Address inconsistencies in class interfaces**:
   - The `Print` class has some commented-out functions and inconsistent method signatures

## Static Analysis Tools

For a C++ embedded project like yours, I recommend:

1. **Clang-Tidy**: 
   - Comprehensive static analyzer that can find a wide range of issues
   - Configurable to your coding standards
   - Can be integrated with your CMake build

2. **CodeChecker**:
   - I see you already have a .codechecker directory, so you might be using it
   - It's a good wrapper around clang tools for easier integration

3. **Cppcheck**:
   - Lightweight tool good for finding memory leaks and undefined behavior
   - Works well on embedded systems code

4. **SonarQube/SonarCloud**:
   - More comprehensive analysis including code duplication, complexity metrics
   - Provides continuous code quality monitoring

5. **PVS-Studio**:
   - Commercial but powerful for finding subtle bugs
   - Has a free usage option for open source projects

## Configuration Example

For CMake integration with clang-tidy:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_CLANG_TIDY 
  clang-tidy;
  -checks=*,-fuchsia-*,-google-*,-zircon-*,-abseil-*,-llvm-*;
  -header-filter=.*)
```

This will run clang-tidy on every file compiled through CMake.

Would you like me to provide more specific recommendations for any particular part of the codebase?

gredzikk: @workspace also are singletons really preferred here since i will ever only need one system clock, one event manager and one nmea data class, one system state manager etc. all logs etc also should be global and accessible everywhere so tell me if this static global singleton is best approach or should i pass them as objects or even some other way/

Workspace: Collecting workspace informationBased on your codebase and requirements, I'll analyze the singletons usage and offer recommendations for improvement.

## Analysis of Current Singleton Implementations

Your codebase uses several approaches to singletons:

1. **Local static instance approach** (proper):
   ```cpp
   static SystemStateManager& get_instance() {
       static SystemStateManager instance;
       return instance;
   }
   ```
   This is implemented correctly in `SystemStateManager` and `EventManager`.

2. **Global instance approach** (problematic):
   ```cpp
   // In main.cpp
   PowerManager powerManager(MAIN_I2C_PORT);
   DS3231 systemClock(MAIN_I2C_PORT);
   ```
   This approach can cause initialization order problems.

3. **Mixed approaches in testing** - using different implementations for test mocks.

## Recommendations for Singleton Implementation

Since you only need one instance of each system service (clock, event manager, etc.), the singleton pattern is indeed appropriate. The best approach for your embedded system is:

### 1. Standardize on Local Static Instance Pattern

```cpp
static ClassName& get_instance() {
    static ClassName instance;
    return instance;
}
```

Benefits:
- Thread-safe in C++11+ (initialization is guaranteed thread-safe)
- Lazy initialization (created only when first used)
- No memory leaks (automatically destroyed at program end)
- Consistent initialization order (avoids the "static initialization order fiasco")

### 2. Add Proper Construction Requirements

For classes that need initialization parameters (like I2C bus):

```cpp
// In header
static ClassName& get_instance();

// In implementation
ClassName& ClassName::get_instance() {
    static ClassName instance(MAIN_I2C_PORT); // Pass any required parameters
    return instance;
}
```

### 3. Use Static Analysis Tools

For enforcing consistent singleton usage, I recommend:

1. **Clang-Tidy** with custom checks:
   ```bash
   clang-tidy --checks="readability-*,performance-*,concurrency-*" *.cpp
   ```

2. **Cppcheck** for memory and thread safety issues:
   ```bash
   cppcheck --enable=all --suppress=missingIncludeSystem .
   ```

3. **PVS-Studio** (if available) for deeper static analysis

## Implementation Example

Here's how to convert your `DS3231` class to the recommended singleton pattern:

```cpp
// In DS3231.h
class DS3231 {
private:
    i2c_inst_t *i2c;
    // Other members

    // Private constructor
    DS3231(i2c_inst_t *i2c_instance);
    
    // Delete copy/move operations
    DS3231(const DS3231&) = delete;
    DS3231& operator=(const DS3231&) = delete;
    
public:
    static DS3231& get_instance();
    
    // Regular methods
    int set_time(const ds3231_data_t *data);
    // ...
};

// In DS3231.cpp
DS3231& DS3231::get_instance() {
    static DS3231 instance(MAIN_I2C_PORT);
    return instance;
}
```

## Alternatives to Consider

While the singleton pattern works well for your case, consider these alternatives:

1. **Dependency Injection** - Pass service instances to objects that need them
   - More testable but more complex

2. **Service Locator Pattern** - Central registry of services
   - More flexible but introduces indirection

However, given the embedded context and your specific needs, the properly-implemented singleton pattern (using the local static approach) is likely the most suitable choice.

Would you like me to provide a concrete implementation for any specific class in your codebase?

gredzikk: @workspace are there any other design patterns i can implemenet/refactor into this code to make it better quality?

Workspace: Collecting workspace informationLooking at your codebase, I can see you're already implementing several design patterns, including Singleton. However, there are additional patterns and architectural improvements that could enhance code quality, maintainability, and testability.

## Design Patterns to Consider

### 1. Dependency Injection Pattern

Instead of hardcoded singletons, implement proper dependency injection:

```cpp
// Current approach
auto& event_manager = EventManager::get_instance();
event_manager.log_event(...);

// Better approach
class TelemetryManager {
private:
    IEventManager& event_manager_;  // Interface reference
    
public:
    TelemetryManager(IEventManager& event_manager) : event_manager_(event_manager) {}
    
    void process() {
        event_manager_.log_event(...);
    }
};
```

This dramatically improves testability while maintaining the singleton architecture at the composition root.

### 2. Factory Method Pattern

For your sensor system, implement factories instead of direct instantiation:

```cpp
class SensorFactory {
public:
    static std::unique_ptr<ISensor> create_sensor(SensorType type, i2c_inst_t* i2c) {
        switch(type) {
            case SensorType::BME280:
                return std::make_unique<BME280Sensor>(i2c);
            case SensorType::INA3221:
                return std::make_unique<INA3221Sensor>(i2c);
            // Other sensor types
            default:
                return nullptr;
        }
    }
};
```

### 3. Observer Pattern

For event handling and notifications between subsystems:

```cpp
class SystemStateObserver {
public:
    virtual void on_state_changed(SystemState new_state) = 0;
    virtual ~SystemStateObserver() = default;
};

class SystemStateSubject {
private:
    std::vector<SystemStateObserver*> observers_;
    
public:
    void attach(SystemStateObserver* observer) {
        observers_.push_back(observer);
    }
    
    void notify(SystemState new_state) {
        for (auto observer : observers_) {
            observer->on_state_changed(new_state);
        }
    }
};
```

### 4. Command Pattern

For handling different communication commands:

```cpp
class Command {
public:
    virtual std::vector<Frame> execute(const std::string& param) = 0;
    virtual ~Command() = default;
};

class GetEventsCommand : public Command {
public:
    std::vector<Frame> execute(const std::string& param) override {
        // Implementation of handle_get_events logic
    }
};

class CommandFactory {
public:
    static std::unique_ptr<Command> create_command(OperationType op_type) {
        switch(op_type) {
            case OperationType::GET:
                return std::make_unique<GetEventsCommand>();
            // Other commands
            default:
                return nullptr;
        }
    }
};
```

### 5. Builder Pattern

For complex object construction like Frames:

```cpp
class FrameBuilder {
private:
    Frame frame_;
    
public:
    FrameBuilder& set_operation(OperationType operation) {
        frame_.operation = operation;
        return *this;
    }
    
    FrameBuilder& set_subsystem(uint8_t subsystem) {
        frame_.subsystem = subsystem;
        return *this;
    }
    
    FrameBuilder& set_command(uint8_t command) {
        frame_.command = command;
        return *this;
    }
    
    FrameBuilder& set_payload(const std::string& payload) {
        frame_.payload = payload;
        return *this;
    }
    
    Frame build() {
        return frame_;
    }
};
```

## Architectural Improvements

### 1. Service Locator Pattern

Instead of global singletons, use a centralized service registry:

```cpp
class ServiceLocator {
private:
    static std::unordered_map<std::string, std::shared_ptr<void>> services_;
    
public:
    template<typename T>
    static void register_service(const std::string& name, std::shared_ptr<T> service) {
        services_[name] = std::static_pointer_cast<void>(service);
    }
    
    template<typename T>
    static std::shared_ptr<T> get_service(const std::string& name) {
        auto it = services_.find(name);
        if (it != services_.end()) {
            return std::static_pointer_cast<T>(it->second);
        }
        return nullptr;
    }
};
```

### 2. Repository Pattern

For data access abstraction:

```cpp
class EventRepository {
public:
    virtual void save(const EventLog& event) = 0;
    virtual std::vector<EventLog> load(size_t count) = 0;
    virtual ~EventRepository() = default;
};

class FileSystemEventRepository : public EventRepository {
    // Implementation using file system
};

class MemoryEventRepository : public EventRepository {
    // Implementation using memory
};
```

### 3. RAII for Resource Management

For safer resource handling:

```cpp
class MutexGuard {
private:
    mutex_t& mutex_;
    
public:
    MutexGuard(mutex_t& mutex) : mutex_(mutex) {
        mutex_enter_blocking(&mutex_);
    }
    
    ~MutexGuard() {
        mutex_exit(&mutex_);
    }
};
```

## Practical Implementation Plan

1. **Start with Interface Abstraction**: Extract interfaces from concrete implementations
2. **Implement Dependency Injection**: Refactor singletons to accept dependencies
3. **Add Command Pattern**: For communications subsystem
4. **Add Observer Pattern**: For state changes and event notifications
5. **Refactor Resource Management**: Implement RAII throughout the codebase

These changes should be incremental, starting with the most critical subsystems like the `EventManager` and `PowerManager`. This approach will greatly improve testability, maintainability, and code quality while making the codebase more robust.
